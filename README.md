TinyBot
=======

This bot will allow for server owners to access their SSH shell via IRC. It will come prebuilt with the most simple of permission systems and the main script will only be 1 file big. A start script will also be added that will loop upon crashing.

As this is my first public bot. Im also going to be accepting requests for changes to the bot.

The main bot features will be:
 - Linux and Windows Compatable.
 - Hostmask specific permissions.
 - Full access to most server side commands.
 - The ability to run mulitple of them on different servers. (Requires a BNC)

As this is a side project, the coding process will be slow. Oh and the entire thing will be PHP :D
